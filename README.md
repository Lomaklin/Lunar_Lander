# Lunar Lander

This is my first foray into coding since I did some basic programing on the Commodore 64 back in 1979/1980.

This game was inspired from that same time period.  In fact, as I am typing up this description I took a minute to do a quick search on when it was released, and it was 1979 by Atari.  Obviously it made an impression, it has been 40 years!

At this point the program is "complete" in that it runs without errors, you have a goal, "Land on the pad before you run out of fuel", and you can start it again or exit cleanly.

## Project Goal

Simple, it was a path to learning Python.  On a Saturday a few weeks ago, I decided I wanted to pickup a programing language, did some research, and Python rang the right bells.  I then thought about what might keep me interested long enough to get past the very real hurdle of learning enough of the syntax to get past the "Hello World" stage.

In my mind I broke it down into stages, and then just researched, and cobbled together code for each stage.  I refined that code as I progressed, and my understanding grew, or as I hit walls that required me to learn entirely new concepts.
